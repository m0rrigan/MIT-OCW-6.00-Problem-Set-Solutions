My time in bootcamp has been incredibly helpful, but I've found my computer science knowledge to be lacking. Therefore, I've decided to start taking MIT's OCW offerings for computer science. These are my problem set solutions for MIT's OpenCourseWare 6.00 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming as taught in Spring 2011.

I'm posting them to GitHub as a way to hold myself accountable, and to be able to look back on my progress.

The full course can be found [here](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/). I highly recommend checking it out.

I will update this README as I go through the course and have more to say.
